OVERVIEW--------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a machine learning classifier that predicts the likelihood of rainfall using historical weather data. The model is trained on features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure to classify whether it will rain or not.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end data science workflow: from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and visualization.



FEATURES-------------------------------------------------------------------

Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, scaling, encoding).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with data visualization.

Implementation of multiple classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualization for performance comparison.

TECH STACK---------------------------------------------------------------
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
